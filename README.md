# Background
Fecal microbiota transplantation is a common procedure used to treat patients suffering from C. diff which consists of an imbalance of normal healthy gut bacteria allowing for the C. diff bacteria population to increase causing symptoms of diarrhea, upset stomach, and signs of dehydration. Healthy bacteria from feces are collected from a carefully screened donor attemping to match the recipients lifestyle to the donor. The collected microbiota is then transferred to the recipient orally or rectally. The bacteria will restore healthy levels of bacteria in the lower intestine and therefore improve metabolic functions.

There is a link to gastrointestinal issues and autism spectrum disorder. The exact cause of ASD is not known but a correlation has been shown to ASD severity and GI symptoms. Previous studies include imporovement of patients' ASD and GI sympotoms after antibiotic treatment, as well as a mouse-model study which linked abnormal metabolism and behavior to the gut microbiota.

This specific study was an open-label clinical trial where both the patients and providers were aware of the treatment being administered. Some patients were either treated with microbiota treatment therapy or not and their gut microbiota was analyzed.
